# InsideWindowsDebugging-TarikSoulami
Sample Source code that came with the Inside Windows Debugging book by Tarik Soulami. The source comes from https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9780735662780-files/ with the additional change of adding solution files for the samples to be built.

Have added all samples in a single solution, which builds all the solutions. To debug exes by using F5 you will need to change the Active Project in Visual Studio.

Visual Studio used is Visual Studio 2017.
